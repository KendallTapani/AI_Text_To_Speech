This is a neat little Nextjs app I put together going through the ElevenLabs API Docs.
The Voices it plays from the text are quite good.
It uses Generic Nextjs, typescript, and tailwind. The main files here are the route.ts, and text-to-speech.tsx files, which have most of the code.
For some of the more complicated stuff in the routes.ts file, I added comments showing what each individual section is actually doing.
The Docs are very easy to go through, and haven't had any issues after initial debugging.
Overall a pretty good experience, and the end product is quite impressive.
The API key isn't active, normally I'd put it into a .env
