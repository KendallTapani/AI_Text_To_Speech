This is a neat little Nextjs app I put together going through the ElevenLabs API Docs.
On the Docs People think this is a python-based API, but you can make the HTTP request in any language, as long as it is formatted correctly. I did it here in typescript without any complication.
It uses Generic Nextjs, typescript, and tailwind. The main files to check out are the route.ts, and text-to-speech.tsx files, which have most of the code, then the generic rendering and stylying make up the rest of it.
For some of the more complicated stuff in the routes.ts file, I added comments showing what each individual section is actually doing.
The Docs are very easy to go through, and haven't had any issues after initial debugging.
Overall a pretty good experience, and the end result is quite impressive.
The API key isn't active, normally I'd put it into a .env, but I want to show the key in a string, and what it looks like for anyone wondering.
