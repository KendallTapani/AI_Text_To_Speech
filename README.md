This is a neat little Next.js app I put together while going through the ElevenLabs API docs. This does NOT install the Elevenlabs library, rather, it makes a manual HTTP request, and gets a response MPEG audio file from Elevenlabs.

If a company has a unique case and aren't able to install the library properly, i.e. dependancy conflicts, serverless functions, or they just need minimal code overhead, they can format an HTTP request manually. I did that it here in TypeScript without any complicated code. 

The app uses generic Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind. The main files to check out are the route.ts and text-to-speech.tsx files, which contain most of the code. The rest is generic Nextjs rendering and styling.

For some of the more complicated parts in the route.ts file, I added comments explaining what each individual section is doing.

Overall, Elevenlabs is a pretty good product, and the end result is quite impressive.

(The API key isnâ€™t active; its normally in a .env)
